qqz, some language

â€¦okay, so what is this?
QQZ is a miscellaneous programming language, at least for now. Don't treat anything that occurs in this pre-release version as a definitive language feature.

To compile it for yourself, compile it (I use `g++ -o a main.cpp`), then edit the i.qqz file and run the executable.
